# Florida Scrub-Jay genome assembly and annotation
  
Scripts for *de novo* genome assembly of the Florida Scrub-Jay (*Aphelocoma coerulescens*) genome.  
  
Input data for basic genome assembly and annotation:  
* PacBio HiFi raw reads  
* Illumina paired-end reads of parents of the reference individual  
* Hi-C reads  
* linkage map  
* RNA-seq reads  
  
Input data for sex-linked scaffold identification pipeline:  
* Paired-end Illumina reads for at least 1 male and 1 female individual (here, I use 25 male and 25 female)
