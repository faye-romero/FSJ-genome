# Florida Scrub-Jay genome assembly and annotation
  
Scripts for *de novo* genome assembly of the Florida Scrub-Jay (*Aphelocoma coerulescens*) genome.  
  
Find the genome assembly under NCBI accession GCA_041296385.1 (UR_Acoe_1.0). Raw sequence reads are available on NCBI under BioProjects PRJNA1076903 and PRJNA1097984. The genome annotation, repeat library and repeat annotation, sex-specific linkage map, and per-chromosome read depth data (inputs for many of these scripts) are available on Figshare at figshare(.)com/projects/Florida_Scrub-Jay_genome_assembly/220939.

Input data for basic genome assembly and annotation:  
* PacBio HiFi raw reads  
* Illumina paired-end reads of parents of the reference individual  
* Hi-C reads  
* linkage map  
* RNA-seq reads  
  
Input data for sex-linked scaffold identification pipeline:
